### Login

```php
function Login()
```
Ask them for their login information. (shows a page for the user to type

 It caches the referring URL in $_SESSION['login_url'].

It is accessed from ?action=login.

Uses Login template and language file with the login sub-template.

### Login2

```php
function Login2()
```
Actually logs you in.

What it does:
- checks credentials and checks that login was successful.
- it employs protection against a specific IP or user trying to brute force
 a login to an account.
- upgrades password encryption on login, if necessary.
- after successful login, redirects you to $_SESSION['login_url'].
- accessed from ?action=login2, by forms.
On error, uses the same templates Login() uses.
